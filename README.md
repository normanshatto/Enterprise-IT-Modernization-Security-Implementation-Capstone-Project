Enterprise IT Modernization & Security Implementation
  This capstone project simulates an end-to-end enterprise IT modernization for a mid-sized engineering organization. The project addresses outdated hardware, unmanaged network infrastructure, and weak   identity security by designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and centrally managed IT environment.
  
Project Overview
  The initiative focused on replacing legacy workstations, deploying managed network infrastructure, implementing a next-generation firewall, and enforcing Microsoft 365 identity management with multi-   factor authentication (MFA). The solution was delivered using a phased project management approach aligned with PMBOK best practices, emphasizing risk management, quality assurance, and stakeholder     communication.
  
Key Deliverables
  - Standardized workstation deployment and lifecycle planning
  - Managed switches, enterprise wireless access points, and firewall security
  - Microsoft 365 identity management with enforced MFA
  - Network segmentation and layered security controls
  - Project documentation, risk register, QA metrics, and implementation artifacts
    
Outcomes
  The completed project resulted in improved system reliability, strengthened cybersecurity posture, reduced operational risk, and improved IT support efficiency. Quality and performance were validated   through defined KPIs, user acceptance testing, and post-implementation evaluation.
